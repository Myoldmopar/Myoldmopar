      <dt>Research Engineer, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, May 2013-Present</dt>
      <dd>I'm having a great time leading development efforts on the building simulation tool EnergyPlus for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  Since taking over technical development, I have overseen the conversion of the codebase from Fortran to C++, the open sourcing onto GitHub, the effort to make EnergyPlus a thread-safe library, and written a new API with C and Python bindings for EnergyPlus.  I've contributed to other projects such as the Technology Performance EXchange (TPEX) and the Standard Energy Efficiency Database (SEED)</dd>
      <dt>Graduate Assistant, Oklahoma State University, January 2006-May 2013</dt>
      <dd>Contributed to a complete re-write of the EnergyPlus central plant simulation, including solution algorithms, pump model re-work, and updating component model design.  Developed a generalized horizontal ground heat exchanger model that includes interaction with a basement zone, specifically for use with foundation heat exchangers. Performed experimental measurement and modeling of transport delay phenomena in piping systems. Worked closely with the Center for the Built Environment at University of California, Berkeley, providing simulation support for Underfloor Air Distribution System research with EnergyPlus</dd>
      <dt>Engineering Consultant, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Fall 2007 & Summer 2009</dt>
      <dd>Utilized EnergyPlus to investigate wall constructions for residential applications, including frame walls, solid wood walls, and phase change materials.</dd>
      <dt>Engineering Intern, Specific Systems, Tulsa, OK, Summer 2005</dt>
      <dd>Introduced to design and manufacturing of modular HVAC equipment; Designed and fabricated parts; Performed various mechanical and structural analysis on designs; Aided in the construction of a thermal test chamber</dd>

  <dl>
    <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications">VBA</a></dt>
    <dd>First semester of college included a course on VBA.</dd>
    <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">Fortran</a></dt>
    <dd>As a part of most engineering courses, we worked on some Fortran projects.  I then continued using Fortran when developing simulation code and tools around the EnergyPlus ecosystem.</dd>
    <dt style="color:#f7da35">Language Interop‚≠ê</dt>
    <dd>My first real experience getting languages talking together was when I first tried to get a VBA program to call out to a Fortran-based library.</dd>
    <dt><a href="">LaTeX</a></dt>
    <dd>Began using LaTeX as a document language for all technical efforts and class homeworks and projects.</dd>
  </dl>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>2010s to Present</summary> 
  <dl>
    <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)">Ruby</a></dt>
    <dd>Played with Ruby during my graduate research, but got into it heavily once working at NREL.  Used it to develop a translator, taking manufacturers data for mechanical equipment and creating EnergyPlus inputs from it.</dd>
    <dt>Python</dt>
    <dd>Used Python exhaustively for countless projects.  Embedded a Python interpreter inside EnergyPlus to create the PythonPlugin system.  Created a Python API around EnergyPlus to enable new workflows.  Debugged inside CPython's implementation to diagnose issues.</dd>
    <dt>C/C++</dt>
    <dd>While I used C and C++ in college, this took off heavily as we embarked on converting EnergyPlus from Fortran to C++.  I oversee many training sessions for the development team and have since embarked on countless refactoring efforts to utilize modern C++ capabilities.</dd>

### Personal/Hobbies

<details>
  <summary>Raspberry Pi</summary>
  Our entire house has become enamored by Raspberry Pi components, specifically the Pico microcontrollers.  We use them to monitor fridge temps, control cosplay costumes, and run chess timers.

<details>
  <summary>Music</summary>
  I've always had a fondness for music of all kinds, and am proficient at guitar and bass, can keep a beat on the drum set, and dabble on the piano.  Favorite band: TOOL.
