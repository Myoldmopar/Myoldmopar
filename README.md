I've been lucky enough to work on a diverse set of projects in my modest amount of years on this planet. Here are some
details on my coding experience:

    <dd>My first programming experience, in the year 1900. Many hours were spent copying the demo programs from the spiral bound user's manual.</dd>

    <dd>Many programs made using this language throughout the 90s, including graphical games, logic puzzles, and random projects.</dd>
