I've been lucky enough to work on a diverse set of projects in my modest amount of years on this planet. Here are some
details on my coding experience:

A "full" list of languages, tools, and packages I've become familiar with over the years:

<details>
  <summary>Operating Systems</summary>

    <li>Linux (lots of distros, all the way back to Mandrake in 1998, but I run Ubuntu natively on my desktop as my preferred OS)</li>
    <li>Windows (I keep functioning VMs of Windows 3.1 and 98 to run old games for fun)</li>
    <li>Mac (I actually kinda like Mac, but it's not as fun as Linux)</li>
  </ul>
